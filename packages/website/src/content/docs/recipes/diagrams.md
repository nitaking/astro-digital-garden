description: Overview of available options for diagrams in Markdown and Astro (text-to-diagram approach)
---

There are two ways to work with diagrams:

1. Embed them in Markdown using code fences. This is the so-called [text-to-diagram](https://stereobooster.com/posts/text-to-diagram/) approach. For example:
   - [[mermaid-diagrams-in-markdown|Mermaid]]
   - [[gnuplot-diagram]]
   - [[graphviz-diagram]]
   - [Astro D2](https://beoe.stereobooster.com/diagrams/d2/)
2. Use them as components inside MDX or Astro pages:
   - [[timeline-diagram]]
   - [[euler-diagram]]
   - [[hasse-diagram]]
   - [[content-graph-visualization|Graph]]
   - [[metro-map-diagram]]
